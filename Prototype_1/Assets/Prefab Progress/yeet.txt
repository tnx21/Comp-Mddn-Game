Merge my work into your unity scene.

Input these co-ordinates into the prefab when merging it into the unity scene1

x = -83.33524
y = 56.03519
z = 1.320306

I didn't upload it from my PC as we were both working on the same unity scene, so if I uploaded it would have a git merge conflict.
Leave it as a duplicate if there are 2 instances of assets, as I will arrange it tonight.
